     DCYF and our community partners will provide free breakfast and/or lunch for all youth ages 18 and

                                                                                                     Did you find what you needed?

     Youth are expected to take all meals home, and lunches are meant to be eaten right away. At some
     locations, breakfast may be given to take home and eat the next day. If breakfast is taken home,
     families should store it safely until it is eaten.


     Meals are available for youth ages 18 and under on a first-come, first-served basis. To pick up
     meals, youth or a parent or caregiver will need to provide the child’s name, grade, and school.
     DCYF may offer more food support if the strike lasts beyond Tuesday, February 10, 2026.
